## 1. Requirements Elicitation Process

### Elicitation Techniques Used
For this project, we used **two elicitation techniques**:
1. **Interviews**
2. **Brainstorming Session**

---

## 2. Interview Process

### Purpose
The goal of the interviews was to collect real information about how university staff and students currently work, what problems they face, and what features they need in the new **Smart University Ecosystem (SRS)** system.

### Participants
We interviewed the following stakeholders:
- **1 Registrar Staff Member**
- **1 Teacher**
- **1 Admin Staff Member**
- **1 Student (our team representative)**

### Interview Details

#### A. Teacher Interview
We first interviewed one of the teachers.  
We asked:
- How do you take student attendance?
- How do you share this attendance with the registrar?
- What problems do you face in this process?
- What features would you like to see in a new system?

**Key Findings:**
- Teachers currently take attendance manually in the classroom by calling students’ names and marking “yes” or “no”.  
- After class, they send this attendance manually to the registrar’s office.  
- Teachers mentioned that this process is slow and can lead to errors or missing records.  
- Teachers want a **digital attendance system** that automatically stores and sends attendance to the registrar.  
- They also want to **upload lecture materials** and have an **easier grading system**.

#### B. Registrar Interview
After talking to the teacher, we interviewed one **registrar staff member**.  
We asked:
- How do you collect attendance from teachers?
- What problems do you face when working manually?
- What new features do you want to make your work easier?

**Key Findings:**
- The registrar currently receives attendance sheets manually from teachers.  
- This causes **mistakes**, **missing data**, and **time delays**.  
- The registrar needs a system that automatically collects attendance and updates student records in real time.  
- They also want to manage course registration, grades, and schedules in one platform.

---

#### C. Admin Staff Interview
We then talked with an **admin staff member** who manages both teachers and registrars.  
We asked:
- How do you manage user access and permissions?
- What problems do you face when coordinating between departments?
- What do you need from the new system?

**Key Findings:**
- The admin manually manages user accounts and permissions, which takes time.  
- They want an **automatic user management system** that allows easy role assignment (student, teacher, registrar, admin).  
- They also want tools to **monitor activities** and ensure data security.

---

#### D. Student Interview
Finally, we interviewed one **student (from our team)** to represent the student users.  
We asked:
- What features would make the system more useful for you?
- How do you want to access the system (mobile or desktop)?
- What problems do you face with the current system?

**Key Findings:**
- Students want a **simple and modern dashboard** to see grades, attendance, announcements, and schedules.  
- They want a **gamified experience** — for example, a scoring or progress system that motivates them.  
- They also want to easily access uploaded lecture materials and reminders for upcoming tasks.

## 3. Brainstorming Session

### Purpose
After finishing all interviews, our team held a brainstorming session to combine all collected ideas and find the most important requirements for our Smart University Ecosystem system.

### Session Details
- **Date:** October 30, 2025  
- **Participants:** All 5 team members  
- **Facilitator:** Requirements Elicitation Lead  
- **Duration:** 1 hour

### Process
1. We reviewed all interview results (teacher, registrar, admin, and student).  
2. We listed all problems, ideas, and features on a shared document.  
3. We grouped them into four categories: Student, Teacher, Registrar, and Admin.  
4. We discussed which features were essential for version 1 of the system.  
5. We finalized the list of functional and non-functional requirements.

### Key Discussion Points
- Automate attendance process between teachers and registrar  
- Add grade and lecture upload system for teachers  
- Add student dashboard with gamified progress  
- Add admin management for roles and permissions  
- Make the system responsive for desktop and mobile users

## 4. Raw Requirements List

### Functional Requirements
- The system allows **login for students, teachers, registrar, and admin**.  
- Teachers can **record attendance digitally** and the data is sent automatically to the registrar.  
- Teachers can **upload grades, assignments, and lecture materials**.  
- Registrar staff can **view attendance, manage student records, and handle course registration**.  
- Admin staff can **create, edit, or delete user accounts** and **assign roles**.  
- Students can **view grades, attendance, schedules, and materials** from their dashboard.  
- The system supports **notifications** for announcements and updates.  

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should be **secure** and protect all user data.  
- It should be **easy to use** and have a clean, simple design.  
- It must work well on **both desktop and mobile devices**.  
- The system should be **fast and responsive**.  
- It should allow **future updates** and system scaling.

## 5. Summary
By using **interviews** and a **team brainstorming session**, we gathered realistic and detailed requirements for the **Smart University Ecosystem (SRS)**.  
The process gave us a deep understanding of how the current manual system works and what improvements users want.  
This documentation provides a strong foundation for the next steps — **system design and development**.
